                <a href="BookDetails.html"><img class = "styleImages2"src="Images/H1.jpg"></a>
                <p>Harry is impatiently awaiting the start of his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After turning thirteen, alone and far from his Hogwarts friends, Harry gets into a fight with his mustachioed Aunt Marge, whom he turns into a balloon, and must escape on a magical bus.

Meanwhile, a terrible villain has escaped from Azkaban prison, Sirius Black, a serial killer with magical powers who was an accomplice of Lord Voldemort and who seems willing to eliminate Harry from the map. And if this were not enough, Harry must also face some terrible monsters, the Dementors, abominable beings capable of stealing the happiness of wizards and erasing all beautiful memories of those who dare to look at them.</p>

                <a href="BookDetails2.html"><img class = "styleImages2"src="Images/H2.jpg"></a>
                <p>Persepolis is the story of Satrapi's unforgettable childhood and coming of age within a large and loving family in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution; of the contradictions between private life and public life in a country plagued by political upheaval; of her high school years in Vienna facing the trials of adolescence far from her family; of her homecoming—both sweet and terrible; and, finally, of her self-imposed exile from her beloved homeland. It is the chronicle of a girlhood and adolescence at once outrageous and familiar, a young life entwined with the history of her country yet filled with the universal trials and joys of growing up.</p>
